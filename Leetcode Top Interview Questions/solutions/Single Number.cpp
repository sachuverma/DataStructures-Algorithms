/*
Single Number
=============

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1


Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
