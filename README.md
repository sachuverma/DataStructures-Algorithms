# DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

`Resources and Solutions` `^_^`

<!-- I am _Sachin Verma_ a student of Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi,
an aspiring **Web Developer** and **Competitive Programmer**. -->

I have compiled many useful links for **Data Structures and Algorithms** questions and their solutions.  
I have also listed the **Theory Subjects**, which are often **ignored** by students but one must have a vast knowledge of them to help them in their interviews.  
I have also included the **Placement Ready Roadmap**, from `beginner level -> interview-ready candidate`

## 🏆 Roadmap to Dream Placement

### 1️⃣ 100+ Top Product Based Companies

People only chase after **FAANG**, because that's what is hyped up but now there are a lot of companies which:  
 - `Good opportunities to enhance oneself`
 - `Pay Exceptionally Well`  
 - `Good Work Life`  
 - `Great Projects/Learning`  
Check their names [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15rjcHqjDN7gPU5e6nxb_9NdApRf4TW1I/view?usp=sharing), and decide where you want to land.

### 2️⃣ Language, Data Structures, CP

- Guide to how to start coding if you have zero knowledge about this field
- Only way to become good at something is to practice, an expert was once a newbie too ;)
- Only consistency matters, coding once a week for 10 hours is not beneficial, rather coding 1 hour each day will benefit you more.

  - What?
  - Why?
  - Where it is physically located?
  - How it is implemented?
    - Demand Paging
    - Strategy to only load pages when they are needed
    - Paging + Swapping
  - Advantages
    - user can write program for extremely large virtual address space
    - [CPU utilisation & throughput] increases & [Response Time, Turn aruond time, TAT] remains same
    - Less I/O would be needed to load or swap user programs into memory, so each user program would run faster
    - Degree of Multiprogramming increases
    - allows file and memory to be shared by 2 or more processes through page sharing
  - If it is used carelessely, it can decrease performance

### 2️⃣ Database Management & Design

Tech Gaints: They usually ask only a bit about normalization, ACID properties(imp.) ans SQP queries & interview is done

Start Ups: They do focus on system design a lot ans in between questions on DBMS are frequently asked
So, we need to be 100% prepared for it & best way is to follow the System Design Primer (resource given below)
Questions always revolves around the type of DB, why this DB, why not that DB, how to scale, [SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/sql-vs-mysql/), your familiarity level with those DBs, etc
